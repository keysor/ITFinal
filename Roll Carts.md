# Roll Carts
I recently wrote a paper on roll carts in Columbia, as in my hometown Kirkwood our county gave us [roll carts](https://github.com/keysor/ITFinal/blob/main/trashcans.jpg)  to put our trash and recycling in which in turn the companies would pick up and dispose of them accordingly.
They're super simple contraptions that allow the trashbags or recycling to be kept put. Otherwise as we see in Columbia holes can tear in the trashbags from animals, weather or human error which when the wind picks up throws the trash everywhere; or simply when the trash truck is driving away they'll be throwing the trash around the city.
[This article](https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/roll-carts-prove-a-tough-sell-for-columbia/article_662045b4-730d-57b5-a387-f78392b3b7ac.html) goes in depth about how roll carts would not only provide us with cleaner streets but also a safer work environment for the trashmen involved.
The article states that "two-thirds of Columbia's trash collectors quit each year on average" which is mostly due to the hazardous conditions the job provides. Rollcarts would help solve this issue.
I was thinking of starting a petition towards Columbia to mandate these roll carts but I haven't had the time to do so yet, I think this should be a nation wide policy.
