# Ocean
I recently watched this super itneresting movie called *Seaspiracy* on Netflix. It talked about how corrupt the fishing market is and how we're slowly destroying our own planet.
It goes on about how the fish market is "accidentally" slaughtering dolphins and sharks and destroying the food pyramid in the ocean which could lead to a huge collapse all the way down to the photoplankton.
It's estimated the the ocean produces [50-80% of our Oxygen](https://aambpublicoceanservice.blob.core.windows.net/oceanserviceprod/news/june14/our-ocean.jpg), mostly plankton in the ocean! Slowly we are destroying everything that keeps all of this in check and in the process destroying the reefs aswell.
If this sounds interesting theres a [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q5CXN7soQg) you can watch on youtube. The director does an amazing job exposing the fish market and potentially putting his own life at risk.
There are an immense amount of plot twists in here that you wouldn't expect from a documentary and there are beautiful shots aswell.
